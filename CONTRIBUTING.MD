# Contributing to Getman

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Getman.
It's people like you that make Project Name such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to check our [Issues](https://github.com/vnpnh/getman/issues) to see if someone else in the community has already created a ticket. If not, go ahead and [make one](https://github.com/vnpnh/GetMan/issues/new)!

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork Project Name](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b add-new-feature
```

## Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

## Make a pull request

Once your changes are ready to be reviewed, create a pull request. 

## And last but not least: Thank you for your contributions!

We love seeing new pull requests, and we do our best to respond as quickly as possible.
